# Delhi Smart Traffic & Pollution Management System

## 🚀 Project Overview
The **Delhi Smart Traffic & Pollution Management System** is an AI-powered solution aimed at addressing Delhi NCR's persistent air quality and traffic congestion challenges. This system integrates **real-time AQI monitoring, predictive pollution modeling, smart traffic control, and emergency alerts** to foster sustainable urban mobility and public health improvements.

## ⚠️ Prototype Disclaimer
This project is currently a **prototype**, meaning that many features are still under development and may not work as intended at this time. However, we are actively improving the system, resolving issues, and adding new functionalities to enhance its performance over time.

## 🌟 Key Features (Work in Progress)
- **AI-Powered Adaptive Traffic Control**: Dynamic traffic signal adjustments based on real-time pollution data and traffic density.
- **Predictive Pollution Modeling & Alerts**: 72-hour pollution forecasting with real-time mobile notifications.
- **Hyperlocal Monitoring & Data Collection**: Integration of multiple APIs for pollution, traffic, weather, and IoT sensor data.
- **Smart Public Transport & EV Integration**: AI-driven route optimization to reduce pollution exposure.
- **Dashboard Features**: Live AQI monitoring, pollution hotspots visualization, and emergency alerts.
- **Public Engagement & Policy Simulation**: Interactive tools to raise awareness and assess mitigation strategies.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, CSS
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow / PyTorch
- **Real-time Notifications**: Google Firebase
- **Hosting**: Vercel / Railway
- **Data Sources**: OpenWeather API, OpenRouteService, TomTom Traffic API, ThingSpeak API, AirGradient Open API

## 📌 Current Limitations & Future Improvements
- 🚧 **Some API integrations may not function fully** due to ongoing development.
- 🏗️ **Traffic signal optimization & predictive modeling are still being refined**.
- ⚠️ **AQI alerts and real-time data accuracy improvements are in progress**.
- 🔧 **UI/UX enhancements and additional feature integrations** are planned for future updates.
